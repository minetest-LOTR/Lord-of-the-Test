## Lord of the Test: A Minetest subgame.
### Latest stable version: 1.0.0

This is a game for Minetest that adds [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) elements into the game.

### NOTE: The dev version of LOTT (anything that is not downloaded from the [release section](https://github.com/minetest-LOTR/Lord-of-the-Test/releases)) only works with the latest dev version of Minetest.
If you want to use the stable version of Minetest, please download the [latest stable version](https://github.com/minetest-LOTR/Lord-of-the-Test/archive/v1.0.0.zip) of LOTT!
(It is recommended that you use the development version of both LOTT and Minetest, as many more features are in both of them!)
