	"\\\nPreface"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nSince the young age of 16. I have devoted my life to travelling the vast regions of Middle Earth and document even the most inaccessible of areas."..
	"\\\nThis book is a compilation of my entire life of work."..
	"\\\nMany thanks to all the people I have met along the way who offered their hospitality to me."..
	"\\\nThanks to my Elven companion, Devdan, who accompanied me for half of my travels."..
	"\\\nThanks also to guards, Merek, Roran and Rulf, who helped as we ventured into the more dangerous regions."..
	"\\\nAll of these contributed to the massive success of this book."..
	"\\\nAnd to you, dear reader and future explorer, I wish you the best in your travels."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nIntroduction"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThis is volume one of three of a work which documents my travels through Middle Earth." ..
	"\\\nThis volume records my venture through the friendly and peaceful regions of Middle Earth."..
	"\\\nI have categorised information about each location neatly. From local inhabitants to notable towns and even interesting areas I have discovered, all are included."..
	"\\\nI hope all this will be of a great help to you, future explorer."..
	"\\\nWithout further ado, let's turn the page, and explore the wonders of Middle Earth!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nThe Shire"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThe peaceful sanctuary of the Hobbits."..
	"\\\nBeing located in the centre and protected by the surrounding lands, the Shire itself has been mostly peaceful, apart from a few rowdy Hobbits causing a slight commotion once in a while, after imbibing a few too many pints of their wonderful ale."..
	"\\\nHobbits primarily inhabit the lands, of which you will find plenty of rich fauna and flora."..
	"\\\nIt's a great place for a holiday and for any new explorers to start!"..
	"\\\nBright green grass is present in this region."..
	"\\\nAnd occasionally you can find a few Hobbit holes where Hobbits are usually more than glad to have a guest!"..
	"\\\nAvoid the ones with 'No Admittance' signs though, as old and grumpy Hobbits live there."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nLothlórien"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThis land is also referred to as 'Lorien' sometimes."..
	"\\\nThe land of the fair Elves."..
	"\\\nProtected by the Elves, it seems to be mostly peaceful."..
	"\\\nBut recently in these dark times, Lorien has been seeing stray orcs venture into the borders of the region."..
	"\\\nDon't worry too much though, the Elves are quick to make simple work out of them."..
	"\\\nDark turquoise grass is present in this region."..
	"\\\nYou will definitely spot the beautiful tall mallorn trees, with their golden leaves."..
	"\\\nBright and stunning flowers decorate the region, some of which may even have magical properties."..
	"\\\nBlessed by the Elves, you might also find magical materials in the region."..
	"\\\nThere's rumours of old Elven forges, containing great treasures, buried below the surface, but not too deep (above depth of 100 metres)."..
	"\\\nThe mallorn trees are sometimes fitted with grand Elven treehouses, a most magnificent sight."..
	"\\\nProbably the most magical and beautiful place I have visited thus far, and definitely worth a visit!"..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nIron Hills"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nAs the name says, in this land, you find gentle rolling hills filled with veins of iron. The hills here are rich in iron, even causing the waters in here to have a slight reddish-brown hue from the iron."..
	"\\\nThis large quantity of ores has of course attracted many Dwarves and some of them have made their home here."..
	"\\\nHidden underground and with hidden entrances, Dwarven home aren't the easiest to find. But the Dwarves are friendly, as long as you make clear you aren't here to cause trouble."..
	"\\\nI have heard some rumours from the local Dwarves that the elusive mithril can be found here."..
	"\\\nNormal green grass is present in this region."..
	"\\\nOne of the most notable features is perhaps the pine trees, still filled with snow from recent snowfalls, due to the altitude, which decorate this region."..
	"\\\nElse, it can be easily identified from the stone cliffs or caves that are filled with veins of iron ore.\"}"
