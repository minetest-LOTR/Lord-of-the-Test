	"\\\nWhen certain materials are bound together, and united into a single, cohesive new material, certain changes take place, not only in their physical structure but also in their capabilities and uses."..
	"\\\nHaving spent many years working on these concepts, with the help and guidance of Annatar, the kindly lord of gifts, we, the elves, have come to a great understanding of these matters, in regards to a few, particular materials."..
	"\\\nFrom this knowledge, we have been able to devise objects of great power, unknown to our land until this time, objects which have been seen only among the Valar." ..
	"\\\n " ..
	"\\\nOur knowledge concerns, in particular, gold, silver and gems fashioned into the form of rings of extraordinary powers." ..
	"\\\nSo that this knowledge might be passed on to the future and to posterity, I have determined that it is necessary for me to write about the process through which these objects are made." ..
	"\\\n " ..
	"\\\nRINGSILVER" ..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThe first steps involve the preparation of ringsilver, out of which the ring is formed." ..
	"\\\nFirst, normal ingots of gold and silver, which even the dwarves consider to be pure, must be taken, and purified further, so that there are no impurities left in them." ..
	"\\\nThis is done simply by heating a gold or silver ingot over a normal fire, and leaving it there for a longer time." ..
	"\\\n " ..
	"\\\nAfter this, the two pure ingots must be heated up, and combined into goldsilver, in a furnace like that used for bronze, made of a normal furnace, with iron above, and to both sides of it. After several goldsilver ingots have been made, they can be smelted, in a special furnace with mithril, over a fire which has had rough rock added to it." ..
	"\\\nThis furnace is made by surrounding a normal furnace in obsidian, so as to prevent it from setting nearby things on fire." ..
	"\\\nWhen the ringsilver has been cooked, it will appear on top of the furnace, propelled out by the force of the blast which happens when the materials combine." ..
	"\\\nThe ringsilver will be very hot, and must be cooled down in natural water, within ten seconds, in order for it to form the correct structure." ..
	"\\\nThen, you have ringsilver, the basis of the ring!" ..
	"\\\n " ..
	"\\\nRINGS " ..
	"\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nOut of the ringsilver, you can then form a ring. This is not easy, despite sounding so." ..
	"\\\nThe ring formed must be perfect in shape, and therefore, cannot be formed in one step." ..
	"\\\n" ..
	"\\\nFirst, two ingots of ringsilver must be taken, and placed together in the dual furnace, which was used to combine the gold and silver earlier." ..
	"\\\nThen, the ingots will fuse together, forming a quarter of a ring. However, they may not form in the correct shape, and will melt in the ashes of the fire." ..
	"\\\nWhen two of these have been obtained, they must be smelted in a fire, in order to obtain a half ring." ..
	"\\\nAgain, the join between these two pieces may be imperfect, and so will be discarded. When two half rings have been obtained, they must be smelted, again, with the chance of failure, to produce a whole ring. " ..
	"\\\n " ..
	"\\\nAfter the ring has been made, it must be prepared in order that a gem might be set in it. First, two pins must be crafted out of ringsilver, one ingot of which  produces both pins necessary, and then, the pins must be added to the ring, one above and to the left, the other above and two the right.  After this has been done, the ring is ready to be combined with the gem." ..
	"\\\nThe gem must be of the puriest and most polished of highest quality, to properly harness its power. Any weaker and the gem will not bind at all." ..
	"\\\nThis process itself is too complicated for this book and I will move it to an additional volume explaining more on that subject." ..
	"\\\n " ..
	"\\\nRINGS OF POWER"..
	"\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nNow, you should have a ring and a gem prepared, and ready to be combined, and have the new properties added to the materials." ..
	"\\\nFirst, the cut, polished gem must be combined with the prepared ring in the dual furnace." ..
	"\\\nThe bond between the gem and the ring may fail, spoiling both of them. But hopefully, the ring and the gem will flawlessly fuse together, creating a united whole, which cannot be separated." ..
	"\\\n " ..
	"\\\nAfter the gem has been fused to the ring, then they must undergo the change of properties. This has two main steps." ..
	"\\\nFirst, the ring must be surrounded with rough rock. This must then be smelted in a very special furnace, along with certain other materials." ..
	"\\\nThe special furnace is crafted in the following way: A ringsliver furnace (mentioned above) is placed in the middle. Below, to the right and left of this are placed blocks of tilkal. Directly above and below the ringsilver furnace are placed blocks of mithril. Above, to the right and left of it, are placed galvorn blocks, and finally, to each side of it are placed blocks of steel." ..
	"\\\nThis complex structure is necessary not only to both absorb and retain heat, but also, the materials themselves contribute to the changing of the properties of the rings." ..
	"\\\nWhen this furnace has been built, it cannot simply be placed down." ..
	"\\\nUnder it, you must place a three by three square of lava sources, and the furnace must rest in the middle of this, directly above the lava." ..
	"\\\nWhen the furnace has been placed, in it must be put the ring, crafted and surrounded in rough rock, one block of mithril, one block of tilkal and one block of galvorn, along with plenty of fuel." ..
	"\\\nIt will take two days and one night for the materials to have mixed, and the ring to be imbued with its power.  When the days and night have passed, stand well back from the furnace. If the ring has been successfully made, there will be an explosion powerful enough to kill nearly everything within a large distance from the furnace, which will leave a large crater, at the bottom of which, you will find the ring." ..
	"\\\nIf, however, the ring is not successfully made, then there will a smaller explosion, but still powerful, and the ring will not be formed. If all is successful, then you will have a ring of power!" ..
	"\\\n" ..
	"\\\nCONCLUSION ----------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThe rings of power are complex things, and the process of making them is also complex. It requires time, patience and a good quanity of resources." ..
	"\\\nWe did not discover this process at one single time, but rather, it took place over a long period of time, with slow steps of discovery, and much experimentation with various materials. You, therefore, unknown reader, have a large advantage over us, with the process written out, I hope with clarity enough so that it is easy to follow." ..
	"\\\nAs a final note, there is only one way in which these rings can be destroyed. They must be thrown into lava, after which you are advised to retreat a fair distance, for the death of the ring is even more explosive that its birth was." ..
