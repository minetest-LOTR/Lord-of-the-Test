# This file contains settings of minetest_game that can be changed in

[Gameplay]

#    In creative mode players are able to dig all kind of blocks nearly
#    instantly, and have access to unlimited resources.
#    Some of the functionality is only available if this setting is present
#    at startup.
creative_mode (Creative mode) bool false

#    Flammable nodes will be ignited by nearby igniters. Spreading fire may
#    cause severe destruction.
disable_fire (Fire) bool false

#    The time in seconds after which the bones of a dead player can be looted
#    by everyone.
#    Setting this to 0 will disable sharing of bones completely.
share_bones_time (Bone share time) int 1200 0

#    Makes trees drop down after being dug, which can be useful due to the
#    massive size of the trees.
#    This can cause extra lag, and can also be disconcerting to players used
#    to normal behaviour.
falling_trees (Falling trees) bool false

[Mapgen]
#    Protects all automatically generated structures, so that players cannot
#    damage, destroy or vandalize them.
#    Requires the areas mod in order to work.
protect_structures (Protect generated structures) bool false

#    Causes the edges of biomes to be mixed with each other, which can create
#    a more realistic feeling.
biome_blend (Biome blend) bool false

#    Allows v6 to be used with LOTT. This needs to be a setting, as mapgen v6
#    does not work perfectly with LOTT, and therefore, should only be used by
#    users who don't mind some mapgen glitches...
lott_v6 (Allow v6 with LOTT) bool false

[Hunger]
#    If enabled, players will have to look watch their hunger levels.
enable_stamina (Enable hunger) bool true

#    If enabled, this will allow players to sprint, if they have enough hunger,
#    at the expense of using up a bit more hunger.
enable_sprint (Enable sprint) bool true

[Mobs]
#    If enabled, no hostile mobs will spawn. Not recommended, as it will take
#    away a large part of the game's enjoyability!
only_peaceful_mobs (No hostile mobs) bool false

#    If enabled, blood particles will not appear when mobs are punched.
mobs_disable_blood (Disable blood) bool false

#    If enabled, mobs will not spawn in protected areas.
mobs_spawn_protected (No mobs in protected areas) int 1 0 1

#    If enabled, mobs fairly far away from the player will disappear.
#    This means that areas will need to be repopulated with mobs when a player
#    revisits them.
#    This can, if there is some lag, result in mobs being removed when the
#    player is fairly close to them, which can make things appear to be buggy!
remove_far_mobs (Remove far mobs) bool false
